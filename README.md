# AVAX Intermediate Module 1

## Description

This Solidity contract demonstrates the use of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` functions in the Ethereum blockchain platform. The contract includes the following functions:

- `passcodeToClub(uint pass)`: Checks if the provided passcode is correct and grants access to "The Club" if it matches the predefined passcode.
- `stakeDOGE(address _address, uint _value)`: Allows users to stake a specified amount of DOGE tokens, but requires a minimum stake of 1000 DOGE.
- `division(uint numerator, uint denominator)`: Performs a division operation but ensures that the denominator is not zero using the `assert` function.

## Usage

1. Open Browser and go the site https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Create a new file with extension .sol and paste the code.
3. Compile the code and deploy.
